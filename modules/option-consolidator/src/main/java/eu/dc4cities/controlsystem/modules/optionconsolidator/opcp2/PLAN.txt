MODEL
------
- automaton generation
    + automaton for fix, migratable, spreadable activity
    - correct initial state
    - multiple states per working mode
- costs
    + cumulative performance
    + cumulative energy
    + transition penalty
- SLA
    + hard cumulative performance
    - soft cumulative performance, price based
    - soft instantaneous, price based
- POWER
    + multiple source
    + hard power capping
    + power/price
- EMA
    + Ren PCT
- POWER BUDGET

- OBJECTIVE
    + minimize energy price
    - minimize TCO (energy price + penalties)
- past completion
